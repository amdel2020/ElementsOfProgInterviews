Forexample,letA =(3,3,1,0,2,0,1} represent the board game, i.e., the ith entry in A is the maximum we can advance from i. Then the game can be won by the following sequence of advances through A: take 1 step from A[0] to A[1], then 3 steps from A[l] to A[4], then 2 steps from A[4] to A[6], which is the last position. Note that A[0] = 3 > 1, A[l] = 3 > 3, and A[4] = 2 > 2, so all moves are valid. If A instead was (3, 2, 0,0, 2, 0,1), it would not possible to advance past position 3, so the game cannot be won.\n",
